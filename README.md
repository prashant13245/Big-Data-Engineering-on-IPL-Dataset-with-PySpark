IPL Data Engineering & Analytics using Apache Spark
Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Big Data Engineering pipeline for analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket datasets. Using Apache Spark, Python, and SQL, the project processes raw match, player, and team data to provide actionable insights about IPL performance trends, top players, and team statistics.

The main objective of this project is to showcase data engineering skills, including data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and visualization of large-scale datasets in a scalable and efficient manner.

Key Features

Data Ingestion & Cleaning: Efficiently read large IPL datasets (matches, players, scores) and handle missing or inconsistent data using PySpark.

Data Transformation: Aggregate and transform raw data into structured formats suitable for analysis using Spark SQL and PySpark DataFrames.

Analytical Queries: Perform complex queries to identify top run-scorers, highest wicket-takers, team win ratios, and player performance trends.

Data Visualization: Generate meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent insights such as runs per season, match outcomes, and team comparisons.

Scalable & Efficient: Designed to handle large datasets, ensuring performance optimization and efficient memory usage using Spark transformations and caching techniques.

Technologies & Tools Used

Big Data Tools: Apache Spark, PySpark

Databases / Querying: Spark SQL, Hive (optional)

Programming Languages: Python

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment / Platforms: Databricks, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Project Workflow

Data Collection: Download IPL datasets (matches, teams, players, and statistics) from open sources or official APIs.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize formats, and convert data into structured formats for Spark processing.

Data Transformation & Aggregation: Use Spark SQL and PySpark DataFrames to calculate player stats, team performance, and match summaries.

Visualization & Analysis: Create visual insights such as top players per season, team win-loss trends, and performance comparisons.

Insights & Reporting: Summarize findings in dashboards, plots, and tables for quick decision-making or reporting.
