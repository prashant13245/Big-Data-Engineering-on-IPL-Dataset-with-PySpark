## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing IPL (Indian Premier League) data** to gain insights about teams, players, and match outcomes. The aim is to **extract meaningful patterns from raw match data** using **Big Data tools** and **Python visualizations**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark** ⚡ – For big data processing and transformation  
- **Amazon S3** ☁️ – For storing and retrieving IPL datasets  
- **Python** 🐍 – For data analysis, scripting, and automation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** 📊 – For generating charts and visualizations  
- **Git & GitHub** 🐙 – Version control and project repository

## 🔹 Key Features / Tasks

1. **Data Collection & Storage**  
   - IPL datasets stored in **Amazon S3 buckets** for scalable and secure storage.  
   - CSV/JSON files organized for efficient access and processing.

2. **Data Processing**  
   - Used **Apache Spark** for cleaning, transforming, and aggregating large datasets.  
   - Handled player statistics, team performance metrics, and match details.  

3. **Data Analysis**  
   - Calculated **top scorers, strike rates, and wicket takers**.  
   - Analyzed **team performance trends over seasons**.  

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Created **interactive charts and graphs** using Python libraries.  
   - Examples:  
     - 🥇 Top 5 run scorers per season  
     - 🎯 Wicket distribution among bowlers  
     - 📈 Team win/loss trends over seasons

## 💻 Sample Python Code (Data Visualization)

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load data from S3
df = pd.read_csv("s3://ipl-data-bucket/matches.csv")

# Example: Top 5 scorers
top_scorers = df.groupby('batsman')['runs'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.barplot(x=top_scorers.index, y=top_scorers.values, palette='viridis')
plt.title("🏏 Top 5 Run Scorers in IPL", fontsize=16)
plt.ylabel("Total Runs")
plt.xlabel("Batsman")
plt.show()
